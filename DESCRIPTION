Description: This package calculates powers and sample sizes required in
    non-inferiority trials with treatment switching from the active control group to 
    the new treatment group, when restricted mean survival times 
    between the two groups are compared.
    nifts consists of two main functions calculate_power and calculate_size.
    The first function calculates powers, including the expected numbers of events 
    in both groups. The latter calculates sample sizes required in trials.
